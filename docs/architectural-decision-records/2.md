## Context and Problem Statement

We need two UIs, the store management UI and the customer UI.

## Decision Drivers

- Requirements for Store Management UIs:
  - must provide great experience on desktop and mobile;
  - must have a web version for cases when the user needs to act outside of their regular
  environment;
- Requirements for Customer UIs:
  - must be performant;
  - must be customizable per store, but not totally customizable;
- Requirements on both UIs:
  - must integrate well with the existing APIs
  - if included as a module on kwik-ecommerce, must work well with Java

## Considered Options

- Option react + next.js:
  - Store Management UI: standalone SSR with Next.js.
  - Customer UI: React SPA managed by Strapi CMS.
- Option htmx + flutter:
  - Store Management UI: standalone Flutter app.
  - Customer UI: module in the API with htmx templates with Thymeleaf.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "htmx + flutter", because Flutter seems to be the most performant since it compiles
to native code and htmx because I didn't find exactly what I wanted on any CMS. Strapi was overly
complex for this task.

### Positive Consequences

- Will leverage a new way of using Spring (Thymeleaf + htmx).
- Flutter will provide great performance.

### Negative Consequences

- Will need to spend quite some time in studying flutter and htmx.
