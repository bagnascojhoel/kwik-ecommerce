# 1. Use different technologies to develop ourselves

Date: 2022-08-21

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We would like to make more money. Developing software in an environment where we have to make
all the decision, like choosing and scoping the product and picking the technologies is a great
way to challenge ourselves and grow. We either create a successful software product or develop
ourselves in our careers. Although I believe that if the product starts taking-off, we
should go with another approach.

## Decision

We should strive for using new technologies and practices that will challenge ourselves, as long as the
product doesn't take-off.

## Consequences

- Good: we will learn and practice more stuff
- Bad: development will take even more time
