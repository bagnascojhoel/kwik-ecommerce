# Use Java For the Back-End

Date: 2022-08-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

My work experience led me to have great knowledge on APIs written in Java and Spring. This
application is a portfolio project that can scale to actual customers but with no rush
in developing. So choosing another framework or language does not improve my curriculum as much as 
showing an extremely complex project leveraging the best of my experience.

## Decision

I will create the API with Java, Spring and other libraries from the same ecosystem. Currently, the
API will use:

- API First Approach
- Ports and Adapters
- Monolith / Modularization
- DDD
- BDD
- Spring, Spring Modulith

> The above list does not limit the technologies allowed in the project. They are just to hint the
> project's direction.

## Consequences

- Good: I will be able to showcase the best of my current knowledge.
- Bad: since I will be working alone and doing the most robust application possible, it will way 
  more time than if I used a simpler stack.
